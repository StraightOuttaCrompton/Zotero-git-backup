Title: Fully Differentiable Procedural Content Generation through Generative Playing Networks
Authors: Philip Bontrager , Julian Togelius
(Submitted on 12 Feb 2020)

    Abstract: To procedurally create interactive content such as environments or game levels, we need agents that can evaluate the content; but to train such agents, we need content they can train on. Generative Playing Networks is a framework that learns agent policies and generates environments in tandem through a symbiotic process. Policies are learned using an actor-critic reinforcement learning algorithm so as to master the environment, and environments are created by a generator network which tries to provide an appropriate level of challenge for the agent. This is accomplished by the generator learning to make content based on estimates by the critic. Thus, this process provides an implicit curriculum for the agent, creating more complex environments over time. Unlike previous approaches to procedural content generation, Generative Playing Networks is end-to-end differentiable and does not require human-designed examples or domain knowledge. We demonstrate the capability of this framework by training an agent and level generator for a 2D dungeon crawler game.
